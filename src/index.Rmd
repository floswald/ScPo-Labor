### Communication and Content

You can have a look at our Syllabus by clicking above on *topics*. Homeworks are posted above under *homeworks*. Please get in touch via our [dedicated slack channel](https://scpo-gradlabor2018.slack.com/signup), to which you have been invited via email.



### Homeworks

You will be required to do homeworks with the `R` language. They alone will determine your grade.

Please do homeworks in groups of 2. You can download the `.Rmd` that is the basis of all homeworks, and just edit this. `Rmd` is short for *R markdown*, and it's a great way to embed (working!) code with text. You can download all homeworks from the associated [github repo](https://github.com/floswald/ScPo-Labor) in the `src` folder. 

Homeworks should be submitted in a private slack channel. you can create a new channel and name it with your first names (Bob and Alice would call their channel `Bob_Alice`). You should then add me to your channel. You should then submit your homework simply by posting a message to that channel, with your `.Rmd` file attached.

Notice that whatever code your write in your `.Rmd` file must run as it is (after installing required packages, maybe). There should be no required inputs for it.

### New to R?

You will first need to install `R` and `Rstudio`. To do this use the following links:

 - [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
 - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
 
Then, get some help:

* There are gazillions of R tutorials online. [this seems like a good place to start](http://scs.math.yorku.ca/index.php/R:_Getting_started_with_R#Starting_to_learn_R:_Tutorials_on_the_Web).
* I like to use the data.table package, and the homeworks use it as well. Here is a [tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.pdf) and a [cheatsheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/img/blog/data+table+cheat+sheet.pdf) for `data.table`
* Here is a [tutorial](http://www.ceb-institute.org/bbs/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/handout_ggplot2.pdf), a [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) and the [full documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) for `ggplot2`.

We will be using several packages, most of which you can install directly:

```r
install.packages(c("devtools","data.table","ggplot2","plyr"))
```

Other packages need to be installed from github using the devtools package:

```r
require(devtools)
install_github("tlamadon/RcppSimpleTensor")
```
